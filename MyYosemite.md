# My Trip to Yosemite National Park

After I graduated from fifth grade in 2025, my family and I decided to have a road trip from home to Yosemite NP in California. We origanally planned to be camping for almost every night, but we ended up mostly sleeping in hotels and inns whenever we couldn't snag a good campsite. This trip was very fun and exciting, so I decided to write a journal about it.
